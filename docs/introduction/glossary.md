??? note "Cluster"

- **What is it?**  
     A group of nodes (computers) that execute workloads in Kubernetes, i.e., run containerized applications.

  It's a technique that groups multiple computational resources into a single logical unit. These resources are interconnected and work together to execute tasks, process data, and store information in a way that improves application performance, ensures high availability, reduces costs, and increases scalability, as resources can be shared and distributed efficiently to meet real-time application demands. Each computer is a "node," and there's no limit to the number of nodes that can be interconnected.

  The cluster is what provides the main advantage of Kubernetes: the ability to program and execute containers on a set of physical, virtual, on-premise, or cloud machines. Kubernetes containers are not tied to individual machines. In fact, they are abstracted across the entire cluster.

- **What is it for?**  
    The cluster's function is to group multiple machines into a single, efficient system, allowing distributed applications to be executed with higher performance and scalability. In Kubernetes, it facilitates container management, reducing complexity, ensuring high availability, and reducing costs. A Kubernetes cluster typically has a master node that manages pods and the system's execution environment.
